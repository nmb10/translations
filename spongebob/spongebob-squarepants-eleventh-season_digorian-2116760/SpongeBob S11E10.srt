00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,175
<i>Aye, aye, Captain!</i>

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,343

00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,062
- Ah, I don't know what I love more, Squidward,

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,330
feeding people Krabby Patties during the day,

16
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,665
or cleaning up their mess at night.

17
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,267
Are you kidding me?

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,435
Look at all this garbage

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,103
those animals left behind.

20
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,839
Hm. - One man's garbage...

21
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,111
So much gum!

22
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,546
Ooh, this is gonna be fun.

23
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,114
Ooh-wah!

24
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,716
Hey, watch it...

25
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,829
Ah! Urchin!

26
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,264
- That's no urchin, it's a Krabby Patty.

27
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:44,402
- Yuck. A rotten Krabby Patty.

28
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,736
- Wait, Squidward!

29
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,338
You can't throw out a Krabby Patty.

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,541
That is just wrong. - But this one is rotten.

31
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,176
Oh, simple Squidward...

32
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,446
- No Krabby Patty can ever truly be rotten.

33
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,215
Here, look...

34
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,627
- Oh, that looks delicious.

35
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,396
Why don't you take another bite?

36
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,231
- No thanks.

37
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,468
Uh, it's so delicious, I think I'll save the rest for later.

38
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,576
No, Patty, you stay where you are.

39
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,347
- Are you doing all right there, friend?

40
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,249
- Oh, I...I'm all right.

41
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,219
Yoo-hoo! What are you?

42
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,256
- Why, I'm your new best friend.

43
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,692
You can call me Cuddle E. Hugs.

44
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,695
- New best friend? I like the sound of that.

45
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,732
- Then bring it in for the real deal!

46
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,233
- Whee!

47
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,869
That's what I call a hug.

48
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,238
Of course it is!

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,308
Hugs is my last name, after all.

50
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,744
- So tender. - I try.

51
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,346
But enough of this. How about you show

52
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,916
your new best friend around town?

53
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,319
- You got it, Cuddle E. Hugs.

54
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,429
Wow!

55
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,698
Wow!

56
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:33,811
- Meow. Huh?

57
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,882
- What a great night!

58
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,552
- Meow? - Oh, hey, Gary.

59
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,922
Say hello to my new best friend, Cuddle E. Hugs.

60
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,326
- A pleasure. - Meow?

61
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,829
- Come on, Gary. Bed time. - Meow!

62
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,264
- Mm! Ooh! - Here's my room!

63
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,632
You can take the bed, if you want.

64
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,368
- Nonsense. We can share it!

65
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,340
Looks like your friend Cuddle E. Hugs

66
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,008
needs to lay off the snacks.

67
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,810
But no need to worry, Spongebob,

68
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,547
I got your new bed right here. - Ha! Ha!

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,782
Whoo-hoo! Hooray!

70
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,590
You are the absolute best at snuggles.

71
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,027
- I didn't get the first name Cuddle for nothing.

72
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,536
How'd you sleep, Cuddle E.?

73
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,638
Oh, good morning, Gary.

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,306
Hey, have you seen Cuddle E. Hugs anywhere?

75
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,441
- Meow? - Where could he have gone?

76
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,976
Aw, what if I never see him again

77
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,746
or feel his furry embrace?

78
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,883
Maybe a bite of Krabby Patty will make me feel better.

79
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,652
Meow...

80
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,522
I don't feel so good.

81
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,591
I must miss Cuddle more than I thought.

82
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,727
- And I miss you. - You're still here.

83
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,863
- Of course I am. - Yee-hee!

84
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,865
Aw. Wow!

85
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,801
That kiss was even more tender than the first one.

86
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,902
- I've been practicing.

87
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,004
It's our ability to give tender head kisses

88
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,641
that separates us from the lower life forms, Spongebob.

89
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,544
- Did you hear that, Gary? Come here.

90
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,651
- So, best friend, what should we do today?

91
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,787
- You should meet my other friends.

92
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,588
They are gonna love you.

93
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,724
- I already love them!

94
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,860
Meow...

95
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,464
- Oh...ooh, there's my buddy, Squidward!

96
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,100
You're gonna love him.

97
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,404
He's funny and nice and very polite.

98
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,340
Hey, Squidward!

99
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,008
Hi!

100
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,843
I said hey, Squidward!

101
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,547
- Please get out of my way, and stop talking to me.

102
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,115
- See, Cuddle E., he said please.

103
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,516
I told you he was polite.

104
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,718
- Who are you talking to?

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,619
- My new best friend. Wanted you to meet him.

106
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,756
- I don't have time for your stupid games.

107
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,925
Now move it!

108
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,428
Sorry about that.

109
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,664
I...I don't know what's gotten into him today.

110
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,533
- No need to be sorry, Spongebob.

111
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,636
I'm your best friend!

112
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,641
- Aw, your furry tummy feels like home.

113
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,878
- Hey, Spongebob, why are you hugging the air?

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,047
- Hey, Patrick, I'm not hugging the air.

115
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,383
I'm hugging Cuddle E. Hugs.

116
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,754
Are you playing some kind of trick on me?

117
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,755
There's no one there.

118
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,791
- Course there's someone here. He's my new best friend.

119
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,160
But I'm your best friend.

120
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,029
- Oh, yes, you are, but so is Cuddle E. Hugs,

121
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:43,868
and I have enough love in my heart for both of you.

122
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,870
- No!

123
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,505
I want all your love!

124
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,073
Give me it!

125
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,743
Spongebob's my best friend!

126
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,413
Mine!

127
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,815
Give me his love!

128
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:03,187
No! No, no!

129
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,455
- What's up with Patrick?

130
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,856
He looks madder than a rattlesnake

131
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,191
in a room full of rocking chairs.

132
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,194
- I just tried to introduce him to my friend, Cuddle E. Hugs,

133
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,762
and he went crazy!

134
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,197
In fact, everyone's acting weird.

135
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,166
They're all pretending they can't see him.

136
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,802
- Well, where is this new friend of yours?

137
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,136
- Oh, not you too, Sandy!

138
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,106
He's standing right there!

139
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,142
Well, I'm sorry, Spongebob, but I don't see anyone.

140
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:29,480
- He's the giant hamster, right there!

141
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,848
- Oh, I get it.

142
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,717
He's your imaginary friend.

143
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,587
- But he's not imaginary. He's real!

144
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,823
- Oh, no need to get so fiery, Spongebob.

145
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,492
It's okay to have an imaginary friend.

146
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,526
Lots of people do.

147
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,862
You two have fun now, ya hear?

148
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,630
- What is going on around here?

149
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,066
I was so excited to introduce you to my friends,

150
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,001
but now they're all acting strange.

151
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:55,473
- I hate to see ya so upset, Spongebob.

152
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,240
But take heart.

153
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,075
There's a reason your friends can't see me.

154
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,677
- There is? - Of course!

155
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,781
Unlike you, they never ate the magic sandwich.

156
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,616
- Magic sandwich? What magic sandwich?

157
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,619
- Why, the one that's as fuzzy as me, of course.

158
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,956
- You mean the moldy Krabby Patty I found at work?

159
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,058
- You say moldy Krabby Patty,

160
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,094
I say magic sandwich.

161
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,930
Maybe I should share my magic sandwich with my friends.

162
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,234
That way, they can see you, and see how awesome you are!

163
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,004
- Yes! Let them witness my fuzzy tummy.

164
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,839
Tummy...

165
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,142
- Tummy, tummy, tummy, tummy, tummy.

166
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,213
There! Enough for everyone.

167
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,984
- Excellent, Spongebob.

168
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,857
Okay, let's go.

169
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,563
Aged Krabby Patties here!

170
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,901
Get your artisanal aged Krabby Patties here!

171
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,704
Did I mention they were free?

172
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,782
- Do you see him, Patrick?

173
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:16,287
Do you see Cuddle E. Hugs?

174
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,990
Yes!

175
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,092
Oh, he's glorious!

176
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,596
- Yeah, his fur looks silkier than actual silk.

177
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,099
- Yes, make them all see me, Spongebob!

178
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,636
Make them all see, Cuddle E. Hugs.

179
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,907
- Spongebob, what are you doing giving away free food?

180
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,943
Are you cra...

181
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,655
I can't resist the fuzzy.

182
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,158
Come, everyone,

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,293
and hug your new best friend!

184
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,239
- No, Cuddle E. Hugs, no!

185
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,744
- Yes, Spongebob Squarepants, yes!

186
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,182
- Sorry, I'm late, I...

187
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,121
Um... back to bed.

188
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,730
I thought we were friends!

189
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,402
What happened?

190
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,674
Well, your friend ate me is what happened.

191
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,942
Not cool!

192
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,312
Yeah, grumble!

193
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,047
- Sorry, everyone.

194
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,786
- You need to imagine your friends

195
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,922
more carefully, Spongebob.

196
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,660
- I just don't get it.

197
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,928
Why did he act like that last night?

198
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,197
I thought we were BFFs.

199
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,867
I need to talk to him.

200
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,043
- Crazy time last night, right, bro?

201
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,878
- Don't "bro" me, Cuddle E. Hugs.

202
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,381
You embarrassed me last night, and you ate all my friends!

203
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,983
Why would you do that?

204
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,017
- Didn't you ever wonder

205
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,087
what the E in my name stands for?

206
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:30,954
It's Eat!

207
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,823
I'm always hungry, ya know?

208
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,059
Well, why didn't you say so?

209
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,828
Here, have the last of my Patty.

210
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,133
Wait, no! No!

211
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,837
What?

212
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,473
Oh, pellets.

213
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,887
<i>- Okay, Patrick, one more book,</i>

214
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,091
<i>then you go to sleep, kay? - Kay.</i>

215
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:11,995
- This one is called "You Can Be Anything."

216
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,633
I can be anything?

217
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,470
- Oh, you sure can, pal. Take a look.

218
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,573
You can be a firefighter...

219
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,376
- You can be a doctor...

220
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,646
- You can be a cowboy.

221
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,615
- That's what I want to be!

222
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,317
- Cowboy. Great choice.

223
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,485
- No, no, no, no, no!

224
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,220
That. - A horse?

225
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,123
Buddy, I don't think you want to be a horse.

226
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,958
- You said I can be anything,

227
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,927
and...and I want to be a horse!

228
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,964
- Sure, sure, you can be a horse.

229
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,433
- Nighty-night, Patrick.

230
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,434
- A horse.

231
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,469
A horse.

232
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,045
- Not yet, Gary. Give me a few more minutes.

233
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,582
What? Uh, Gary?

234
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,084
- Meow.

235
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,295
- Oh, horsey!

236
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,668
Patrick, you were right! You can be a horse.

237
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,040
Easy there, big fella.

238
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,608
Easy...

239
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,646
Ha!

240
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,317
That's a good horsey.

241
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,220
Hmm, "horsey." That's not right.

242
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,288
You need a name!

243
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,424
I think I'll call you...

244
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,659
Patrick!

245
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,396
Whoa!

246
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,465
Ride 'em, cowboy!

247
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,576
Uh, bucking bronco.

248
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,047
- Rodeo clown.

249
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,218
- Safety first.

250
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,554
Giddy up, Patrick.

251
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,557
Looking good, Ms. Sandy. - Thank you.

252
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,727
And the horse you rode in on?

253
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,796
- Morning, old timer.

254
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,774
- Can we pet him, mister?

255
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,611
- Sure, but be gentle.

256
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,550
- He's so soft.

257
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,386
- What's all the hubbub out here?

258
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,687
What the...

259
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,758
So Patrick's a horse now?

260
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,792
Ha-ha!

261
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,261
Your phony baloney pony's

262
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,296
more like an old gray mare.

263
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,298
Sorry to say, but, uh,

264
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,302
this one's ready for the glue factory.

265
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,539
- What kind of hub...

266
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,443
What are you doing violating me personal space?

267
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,748
- Aw... - He's really fuzzy.

268
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,122
Horsey rides!

269
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,423
Kids love horseys.

270
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,458
Great idea having Patrick play pony.

271
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,794
I'll charge these kids ten bucks a ride

272
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,396
and cash in big time!

273
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,530
- Oh, I don't know, Mister Krabs,

274
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,866
I think Patrick will only let me ride him.

275
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,668
- Oh, nonsense.

276
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,138
Pony rides! Ten buckaroos!

277
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,417
Giddy up, Patrick. Giddy up.

278
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,185
- Now, I don't mean to nag,

279
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,387
so don't bridle when I say this,

280
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,825
but your dream horse is more like a nightmare!

281
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,226
Get it?

282
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,895
Night? Mare? Ha-ha!

283
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,504
- Oh, yeah, now you're feeling your oats.

284
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,407
Ha-ha! I'm so good.

285
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,844
Four at a time

286
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,412
quadruplicates me money.

287
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,282
Let's try for five.

288
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,520
Uh-oh. Ooh.

289
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,723
Oh! Ooh.

290
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,860
My wittle weg!

291
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,729
Yay!

292
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,599
All right, next up.

293
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,207
My other wittle weg!

294
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,710
Horsey Patrick, come back!

295
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,514
- That's me money running away! Come back!

296
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,251
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, come back.

297
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,589
I said, "Whoa, horsey Patrick."

298
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,691
Look at me, I'm a horse.

299
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,794
Clopity, clopity, clopity.

300
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,602
Clopity, clopity, clopity.

301
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,975
- Patrick.

302
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,510
Patrick...

303
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,445
Patrick.

304
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,980
Patrick!

305
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,895
Patrick?

306
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,230
Hey, it's okay, boy.

307
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,999
It's me...

308
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,234
- Your old pal, Spongebob.

309
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,303
Remember?

310
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,906
- Okay...

311
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,975
Would you like me to whisper?

312
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,612
- Nice Patrick. Pretty Patrick.

313
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,681
Good Patrick.

314
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,750
- Calm down, buddy.

315
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,918
I don't want to lose you again.

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,253
Whoa! Ow! Ow!

317
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,733
- Aw. And all this time,

318
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,570
I thought I was the one breaking you,

319
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,740
but you were the one breaking me.

320
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:37,280
Patrick horsey, giddy up!

321
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,567
- What?

322
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,070
- Oh, this is humiliating. - Quiet.

323
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,905
Horseys don't talk.

324
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,574
Okay, kids, ten bucks a ride!

325
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,510
Who's next? - Me!

326
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,579
Get moving, horse!

327
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,814
- Ow! Cut it out.

328
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,782
Ride's over. Who's next?

329
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,651
Wow, Mister Krabs.

330
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,554
How'd you get Squidward to give rides?

331
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,391
Says right here in his contract.

332
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,860
"I can work him like a horse."

333
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,966
- Hey, get your mule away from my show pony.

334
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,802
This here's a Thoroughbred.

335
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,606
Look at that flank.

336
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,542
Get a load of those hocks.

337
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,379
Not to mention that loin?

338
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,047
- Oh, yeah, I'm a real stud.

339
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,450
- Now look at your old pile of dog food.

340
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,721
- I'd put my pile of dog food

341
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,590
up against your stud any day.

342
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,992
- Oh, yeah? How 'bout a race, then?

343
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,461
First one to deliver a Krabby Patty

344
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,431
to Black Devil Bay wins.

345
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,099
- You're on!

346
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,770
- I want a clean race. No cheating!

347
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,439
Wait for the bell.

348
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,614
- Ha-ha! Eat me dust!

349
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,449
- Well, okay.

350
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:30,026
Mmm. Hey, your dust was delicious!

351
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,928
- This shortcut sign

352
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,930
should send Spongebob and Patrick

353
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,966
far from the finish line.

354
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,470
Hi-ho, Squidward!

355
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:44,107
- Whoa! Whoa, shortcut.

356
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,109
This could be a trick.

357
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,445
I love tricks!

358
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,691
Whoa, whoa!

359
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,795
Hyah!

360
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,797
Oh, boy, we're ahead!

361
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,133
- No, you're actually behind!

362
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,671
- Huh? Whoa, Patrick.

363
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,705
Whoa.

364
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,753
Have some slippery mustard, slowpokes.

365
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,458
- That was extra spicy slippery mustard!

366
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,696
- Oh, ratfish!

367
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,632
I've got one more trick up me sleeve.

368
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,935
- This is the police.

369
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,038
I'm pulling you over for speeding!

370
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,873
No, this is the police.

371
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,010
I'm pulling you over for impersonating an officer.

372
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,683
- Here's your delivery, sir.

373
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,088
- What?

374
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,890
I was hungry.

375
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,696
We win! We win!

376
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,932
- I...I had the best horsey! I had the best horsey!

377
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,202
- I don't want to be a horse anymore.

378
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,172
Okay, buddy, but remember,

379
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,008
you can still be anything.

380
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,510
- In that case,

381
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,879
I think I'll be...

382
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:30,714
a crab!

383
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,016
Ark, ark, ark, ark, ark, ark!

384
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,552
Oh, no, you don't!

385
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,520
Come back here with me claws!

386
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,956
How 'bout a ride back

387
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,792
to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy?
