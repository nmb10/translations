1
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:10,568
Are you ready, kids?

2
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:12,396
Aye, aye, Captain!

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,844
I can't hear you.

4
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:15,568
Aye, aye, Captain!

5
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:09,672
Wait for it...

6
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,189
Another day, another migraine.

7
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:30,775
Mi...

8
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,051
...graine.

9
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,120
Isn't it great

10
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,672
working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward?

11
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,672
Huh? Isn't it?

12
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,775
Working here?

13
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,810
Yeah, great.

14
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,086
Yeah.Yeah.

15
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,189
Oh, yeah.Yes!

16
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,637
Hold that thought, Squidward.

17
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,982
I'm due in the parking lot for early morning litter patrol.

18
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,879
May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.

19
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,120
Litter.

20
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:02,603
Looks like someone missed the trash basket,

21
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,741
huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?

22
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:05,568
Kids these days.

23
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:09,362
I've never seen such an epidemic!

24
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:11,431
Well, at least it's all over now.

25
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,224
Where is all this litter coming from?

26
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:34,189
Not on my watch.

27
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,741
Sir, I will have you know

28
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:37,362
it's against the law to litter.

29
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:39,465
Ha! What are you going to do,

30
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:39,706
call the police?

31
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:42,706
Yes.

32
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,224
How's it going, lieutenant?

33
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:54,051
Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there

34
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:55,948
saved room for his just desserts.

35
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,465
Yeah!

36
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,672
Just desserts.

37
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,396
Whatever.

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Spongebob, don't you know who that is?

39
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,362
Who?

40
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:08,086
That's the Tattletale Strangler!

41
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,017
Who?

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,500
The Tattletale Strangler!

43
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:12,637
He's promised to strangle anyone

44
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,327
who turns him in!

45
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:19,810
He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?

46
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,775
Squidward?

47
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,017
Squidward!

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,603
You're going to do time, Strangler.

49
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,775
Hard time.

50
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,120
Hi, officers.

51
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,086
So he's going to jail, right?

52
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,258
Who, Strangler?

53
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:32,810
Yeah, Strangler.

54
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:33,982
Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,017
He's going to jail for a long time.

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,810
Hey, that looks like me!

57
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:46,465
Don't worry, Spongebob,

58
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:48,362
he won't be able to strangle you.

59
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:50,672
Yeah, we got him chained up real good.

60
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,982
He'll never get away.

61
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,362
Oops, not again.

62
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:54,982
Yup, he got away.

63
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:01,224
You nice officers will protect me, right?

64
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:03,362
We ain't bodyguards, kid.

65
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:04,913
Yeah, give us a call

66
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,293
if you see him again, tattletale.

67
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:13,603
Those officers are right-- I need a bodyguard.

68
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,810
Mister Krabs!

69
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,879
There's a maniac after me.

70
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:19,568
I need a bodyguard!

71
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:25,051
I wasn't five-time golden claws in the navy

72
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:26,120
for nothing.

73
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,500
When he see me moves,

74
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:29,465
he'll be running scared.

75
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,603
So where is this little bully,

76
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:32,948
down at the park?

77
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:34,431
The soda shop?

78
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,362
What does he look like, eh, boy?

79
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:37,844
This would be him, Mister Krabs.

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,362
The Tattletale Strangler!

81
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:42,913
Go away, Spongebob.

82
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,362
Take your death cloud with you!

83
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,327
Hold me! Hold me!

84
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,189
That's it, I got to get out of town

85
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:03,465
till I can find a bodyguard.

86
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:05,086
Bodyguard, huh?

87
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,017
Uh, I might be able to help you out.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,534
You don't understand, mister.

89
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,706
I need protection from the scariest guy in town.

90
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,913
Here's his picture.

91
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,810
He doesn't look so tough.

92
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,362
I tattled on him,

93
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,431
and now he wants to strangle me

94
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,224
with his diabolical hands!

95
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,913
I hope they're not dirty.

96
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:33,120
Uh-oh, there's too many witnesses around here.

97
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,051
Listen, kid, I could be your bodyguard.

98
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:37,465
Here's my card.

99
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:39,913
Looks good to me.

100
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:41,189
You're hired!

101
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,224
I feel safer already. What's next?

102
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:45,775
Well, the maniac could be anywhere

103
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,258
wearing a disguise.

104
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,879
He could be that old man.

105
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:49,982
Or that baby.

106
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:51,189
Or that pebble!

107
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,189
Or that stick.

108
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:53,362
Or that receipt

109
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,775
for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium.

110
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,017
that's mine.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,017
Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands.

112
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,603
What do we do first?

113
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:05,396
Uh... I suggest we go to a nice quiet, secluded location,

114
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,017
like behind an old dumpster, or a dark alley.

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,293
We could go to my house

116
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:10,913
and turn off all the lights.

117
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,362
Perfect.

118
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,948
That way no one could hear you being strangled--

119
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,534
I mean, uh, uh, protected.

120
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,775
Perfect.

121
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,051
Yes, excellent.

122
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,672
Ah, but first I got to do a few errands.

123
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,637
Uh, okay, but let's make it quick.

124
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:39,672
"Quick" is my middle name.

125
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:42,603
Let's see, paper towels.

126
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:45,672
This one says, "Best paper towel around."

127
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,155
This one says, "Best paper towel in town."

128
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,120
"In town."

129
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,189
"Around."

130
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,120
"In town."

131
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,465
"Around."

132
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,258
What do you think, bodyguard?

133
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,810
Whatever gets us to your house quicker.

134
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:00,603
I'll take both!

135
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,775
Here you go, Mr. Squarepants.

136
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:05,500
Is there something wrong?

137
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:08,775
I'm not sure if these are my pants.

138
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:15,258
How about this one, bodyguard?

139
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:16,362
Too overbearing?

140
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:19,155
Can we just go to your house?

141
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,431
Here we are, Squarepants Manor.

142
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,913
Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity

143
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:28,637
to say you're the best bodyguard a fellow could hope to have.

144
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,913
All right, enough of the sappy talk.

145
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,603
Open the door so I can strangle you...

146
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:34,844
I mean, uh, choke you...

147
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:37,396
I mean, uh, crush your windpipe... I mean...

148
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,293
"Protect me"?

149
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,327
Thanks.

150
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:40,775
Don't mention it, Strangler...

151
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:42,741
I mean "bodyguard."

152
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,327
Now, where did I put my key?

153
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,741
Well, I can't find them.

154
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:52,258
Do you want to take a look?

155
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,396
Forget the key!

156
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,051
Let's climb through this window.

157
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,637
I can't reach it.

158
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,844
Can you hop up on my shoulders, kid?

159
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,051
Sure.

160
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,844
With these spiky cleats, anything is possible.

161
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,120
"Cleats"?

162
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,810
Get your feet out of my eye sockets!

163
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:14,465
I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!

164
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,844
Get off! Get off!

165
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:32,879
Don't be mad, bodyguard.

166
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,431
Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat

167
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,500
and we can get inside.

168
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,293
There you are, you little rascal.

169
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,706
Now to put it in the lock,

170
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,982
which should activate the tumblers,

171
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,396
thus opening the door.

172
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,879
Step inside...

173
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:52,637
Close the door...

174
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,810
Well, here we are.

175
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:58,637
I finally got you all alone!

176
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:04,017
I know, isn't it great?

177
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:11,844
Ooh!

178
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:16,534
Now you're going to get yours, tattletale!

179
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,913
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!

180
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:23,982
A surprise party to celebrate

181
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:27,051
my perfect on-time percentage at work?

182
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,500
Oh, how'd you guys know?

183
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,879
It's on the invitations you sent us.

184
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:32,396
Let's boogie!

185
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,879
Bye, everybody, thanks for coming!

186
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,844
Bye, Mister Krabs, bye, Plankton, bye, Sandy, bye, Larry,

187
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:49,982
bye, Pearl, bye, Mrs. Puff, bye, Squidward, bye, the rest.

188
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,534
Alone at last.

189
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,224
Huh? What? What?

190
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,189
So we're all alone now?

191
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:04,362
Just you, me and the floorboards.

192
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:10,189
Yeah!

193
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:17,500
Happy birthday, Spongebob!

194
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,775
How did you guys know today is my birthday?

195
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,741
We just do what the invitations say.

196
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:25,017
Let's boogie some more!

197
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,810
Thanks for coming!

198
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:40,879
Alone again.

199
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:41,706
Is it true?

200
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,224
Everybody's gone?

201
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,741
No more parties today?

202
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,637
You've got everything you need now?

203
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:49,844
Nobody's left, we're completely alone?

204
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:51,051
Oh, yeah.

205
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:52,637
In that case...

206
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,396
Great parties, huh?

207
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,293
Sorry, tubby, you got to go.

208
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,086
Wait, we can trust Patrick.

209
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:02,465
He's my best friend.

210
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,224
Well, uh, I can't take any chances.

211
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:07,086
For all we know, uh, he could be the Strangler.

212
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,706
I'm the Strangler?!

213
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,431
Oh, I should have known!

214
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:11,741
I got to turn myself in!

215
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,948
So Patrick's the Strangler.

216
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,810
Gee, you think you know a guy.

217
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,568
He's not the Strangler!

218
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:22,465
He's not?

219
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,775
I am!

220
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,362
Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?

221
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,948
Oh, it's a fake, you idiot!

222
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:31,637
I bought it at the party store!

223
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,568
Did someone say "party"?

224
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,362
I can't take it!

225
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,465
Wait, bodyguard, I need protection!

226
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,706
Step on it!

227
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,293
I'm being chased by a maniac!

228
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:46,913
I'm not safe!

229
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:48,293
Come back!

230
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,603
Finally! Away from that guy.

231
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:56,258
Good idea, bodyguard.

232
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:57,672
He'll never find us up here.

233
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,637
Good thinking, bodyguard.

234
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,155
The Strangler could have been on that plane.

235
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,568
Bodyguard! Bodyguard!

236
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,879
Look, kid...

237
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,568
I'm not your bodyguard!

238
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,879
I'm the Strangler.

239
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,017
See?

240
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,844
The Strangler!

241
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,534
Good work, Spongebob.

242
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:31,086
You put the Strangler behind bars.

243
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,258
At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.

244
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,603
Hey, Mack.

245
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:37,293
What are you in for?

246
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:53,258
Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks,

247
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:56,051
the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom.

248
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,603
All the greatest pranksters shop here.

249
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:01,603
This is where I got my gag seanut brittle can.

250
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,465
Oh, boy, seanut brittle-- give me!

251
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:05,775
Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?

252
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,086
Nice try, Squarepants, but it's not going to work this time.

253
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,258
I'm going to have some of your delicious seanut brittle.

254
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,948
Where's the seanut brittle?

255
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:19,396
That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick.

256
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,844
Come on, let's go inside.

257
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,810
Seanut brittle.

258
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,948
Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items.

259
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:33,775
Pranks, gags and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see.

260
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,500
Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?

261
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:37,810
Hey, seanut brittle!

262
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,224
Oh, darn it, not again.

263
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,844
Good to see you, Spongebob.

264
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,120
How's my number one customer doing?

265
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,189
Great, Frank.

266
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,568
This is my friend, Patrick.

267
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,431
He wants to become a prankster, too.

268
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,362
Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

269
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,948
That's your first lesson, son--

270
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,810
the granddaddy of all pranks,

271
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:00,982
the joy buzzer.

272
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:02,155
I don't get it.

273
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,603
You don't have to get it.

274
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:06,706
The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.

275
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,431
You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master.

276
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,155
I learned all I know about pranks from him.

277
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:13,706
Frank, let's see what you've got.

278
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,879
Well, this came in just this morning.

279
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:17,465
Have some gum.

280
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,500
Ha! Exploding chewing gum, only $9.95.

281
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,775
I don't get it.

282
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,672
What can we get for one dollar?

283
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,051
One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar--

284
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:32,155
fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.

285
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:33,465
What else have you got?

286
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:34,637
A whoopee cushion?

287
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,293
Nah.

288
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:36,603
Fake vomit.

289
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:37,327
No.

290
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:38,637
Real vomit.

291
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,431
Eww!

292
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:40,810
Have anything good?

293
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,948
Well, there is one prank that I've been saving

294
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,913
for a real top-of-the-line prankster--

295
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:49,155
invisible spray.

296
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:52,327
Wow, invisible spray!

297
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,741
But I can see it.

298
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,051
Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks

299
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:57,327
we could pull with this.

300
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,810
Good choice.

301
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,879
Now, be careful with that stuff, boys.

302
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:02,844
It stains clothes.

303
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:04,189
Thanks, Frank.

304
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,534
Here it is, Patrick,

305
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:07,844
the ultimate prank--

306
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,810
invisible spray.

307
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,913
What are we going to do with it?

308
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,224
I know!

309
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:13,913
We'll go spray the park bench

310
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:15,155
and then sit on it,

311
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:16,672
and when people walk by,

312
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,741
we'll be floating in midair.

313
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,086
They're floating in midair!

314
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,568
How do they do that?

315
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,224
That's the ultimate prank!

316
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,741
Good idea, Spongebob!

317
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,189
Well, let's get started.

318
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:30,500
Okay, I'm ready.

319
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:33,706
Any particular reason you took your pants off?

320
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,982
Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?

321
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:38,500
That it does, Patrick, that it does.

322
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,534
Good thinking.

323
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,810
Here, hold this a second.

324
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:43,741
Okay, Patrick, give me the can.

325
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,672
I think since spraying the park bench was my idea,

326
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:48,327
I should get to spray it.

327
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:49,982
Patrick, spraying the park bench

328
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,258
was myidea.

329
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,258
Yeah, but I said it was a good idea.

330
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,258
Give me that thing.

331
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:01,810
Hey, the invisible spray works!

332
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,913
And on your right if you look,

333
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:07,086
you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint.

334
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,155
Oh, my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!

335
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,431
I got to handit to you, Spongebob.

336
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:19,568
You look kind of funny.

337
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,982
Righty, where are you?

338
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:25,741
No one messes with Righty!

339
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,155
We'll see how youlike it.

340
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,913
Kind of gives you an emptyfeeling, huh?

341
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:33,879
Yeah!

342
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:36,120
I seewhat you mean.

343
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:40,603
No guts, no glory!

344
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,948
I think this thing is empty.

345
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,810
Oh, no, it can't be!

346
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:52,189
How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank?

347
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:53,431
Thanks a lot, Patrick.

348
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:54,568
You used the last of it.

349
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,775
Hey, I think I found our pants.

350
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:00,741
Oops! Here, these are yours.

351
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,396
Oh, forget the pants, Patrick.

352
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Let's get home and wash this paint off.

353
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,810
Hey, Spongebob, do you know what time it is?

354
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:10,120
Oh, sure, it's... half past invisible.

355
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:11,534
Gee, it's getting late.

356
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:12,982
Let's ask this guy.

357
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:15,258
Sir, but do you have the time?

358
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:16,500
Sure, it's ten to 3:00.

359
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,534
Thank you.

360
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,534
Don't mention it.

361
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,948
Don't mention what?

362
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:21,017
Who said that?

363
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,948
Me.

364
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,258
Ghosts!

365
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,534
Hey, I'm no ghost!

366
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:31,465
The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.

367
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,534
Wait a second, Patrick,

368
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,327
my brain just hatched an idea.

369
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:36,431
Lay it on me.

370
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,327
Okay, we're invisible, right?

371
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,706
Yeah.

372
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,879
If that guy thought we were ghosts,

373
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,258
we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom.

374
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,844
Oh, it's the ultimate prank.

375
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,051
High five!

376
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:51,051
Let's go scare us some suckers.

377
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,086
That's funny, I thought I heard voices.

378
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:06,637
I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table.

379
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:09,293
And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday?

380
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:13,396
And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?

381
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,672
We're ghosts.

382
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,155
I knew it was you guys!

383
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,844
All right, joke's over.

384
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:27,706
Take off the sheets.

385
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:29,844
It isghosts!

386
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:44,120
Boy, we really scared her!

387
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:48,500
Who's going to be our next victim?

388
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,810
A better question would be, "Who isn't?"

389
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,706
Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake!

390
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,775
You will soon be mine.

391
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:09,293
Ghosts!

392
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:22,810
Ghosts!

393
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:27,189
Patrick AND Spongebob Cowabunga!

394
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:28,086
Ghosts!

395
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,568
Ghosts!

396
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:32,051
Ghosts!

397
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:33,189
Ghosts!

398
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,155
Ghosts!

399
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,293
Toast.

400
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,258
Ghosts!

401
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:41,568
It's official-- we're the greatest pranksters ever.

402
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,362
The whole town thinks we're ghosts.

403
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,017
Yeah.

404
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,327
There's only one guy left to scare,

405
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:50,189
and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--

406
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:52,258
Mister Krabs.

407
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,948
It says he isn't scared of ghosts.

408
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,844
We'll see about that!

409
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,224
Ghosts!

410
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:02,327
Hah!

411
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,500
I ain't afraid of no ghosts!

412
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,948
Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella

413
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,120
as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...

414
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,603
and his dried-up sea leprechaun.

415
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,637
And a bit of gold never hurt.

416
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,327
But to be on the safe side,

417
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:20,465
I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,

418
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:22,465
got me shivering timber brace,

419
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:26,913
and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.

420
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,982
And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor.

421
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:35,534
And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon--

422
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,120
the specter deflector.

423
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:40,189
So just try and get me, you ghosts!

424
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:41,913
Bring it on!

425
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:46,568
Krabs.

426
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:50,396
Krabs, we've come to haunt you.

427
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,465
Stay back, I'm well-armed!

428
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:58,362
I'm warning you.

429
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,741
Ooh!

430
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,258
Boo.

431
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,189
I got to get out of here!

432
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:14,879
You can't escape, Krabs.

433
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,017
We glued the door shut.

434
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,913
You'll never get me!

435
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,672
Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber.

436
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:34,879
Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets.

437
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:38,017
Please, spirits, leave me be.

438
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,293
We got him good, Spongebob.

439
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:44,396
Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.

440
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,362
You're going to pay, Krabs.

441
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,017
No, spirits, please!

442
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,465
No!

443
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,879
No!

444
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,293
Don't burn me dollar!

445
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:06,568
Well, well, well, if it isn't Spongebob and Patrick.

446
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,017
I know not these names

447
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,396
of which you speak.

448
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,086
Uh, Spongebob.

449
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:16,500
Spongebob, we're visible again.

450
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:22,189
So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts.

451
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:23,603
We're really sorry, Mister Krabs.

452
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:26,706
Please don't chop us up into little pieces and eat them.

453
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,465
Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip.

454
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:31,913
I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age,

455
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,155
had me some laughs.

456
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:35,362
That's what we did tonight, right?

457
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:36,706
We had a good laugh.

458
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,258
Come on, laugh with me.

459
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:51,293
Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?

460
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:53,500
Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.

461
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,293
Of course it does.

462
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:59,293
Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees you nude.

463
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:02,465
Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.

464
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:03,672
Me, too.

465
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,120
No, wouldn't want that, would we?

466
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:06,258
It's getting late now.

467
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,155
You pranksters better get going.

468
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:11,120
Mister Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.

469
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,258
Don't mention it.

470
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:15,396
That Mister Krabs, always looking out for me.

471
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,396
What a guy!

472
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,396
Yeah.

473
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,741
The Krusty Krab presents...

474
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,982
live nude pranksters!

475
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:26,362
Starring the Bikini Bottom ghosts.

476
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:38,568
Patrick!

477
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,155
Yeah?

478
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:43,327
We should have bought the whoopee cushion.
